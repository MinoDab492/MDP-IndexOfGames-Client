<h1>Version History</h1>
<p id="descriptor">This is a simple page containing every changelog for every version.</p>

<h3>Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release)</h3>
<p>Changes: Finalized some code changes for additional compatibility regardless of platform, as well as removing the internet dependency. (Has the side effect of bypassing GoGuardian on school chromebooks, but that totally means nothing, right?)</p>

<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<p>Changes: Updated some dependenices to patch some security flaws.</p>

<h3>Version 1.1.0</h3>
<p>Updates the Electron Client to remove offline files temporarily. This is due to certain parts of the Index being rebuilt from scratch in a more modifiable manner, as well as other planned changes. Additionally, this updates the Index to use the new link which (as of release) isn't blocked.</p>

<h3>Version 2.0.0</h3>
<p>An overhaul of everything. This version page is the only thing that remains. It's dangerous to go alone, take a changelog. <br>Updated FlappyJPEG. This change implements a new, second version of the game, named FlappyPNG. This is identical, just with different art for the bird. Which version you get is determined by a random number generator. <br> Rebuilds the main page in a more modifiable way, currently it doesn't look as fancy, however, eventually, I will attempt to work back to that, however, the old page was terriblydifficult to add to, so this fixes that.</p>
