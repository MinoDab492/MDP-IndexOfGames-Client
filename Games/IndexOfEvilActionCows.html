                    <strong>Chapter 1 (Evil Action Cows: The Original)</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">There once was a small farm, owned by one man named Bob Boberson “Bunch of Bobs In His Name” Bobb, it was full of lush green grass, covered by the snow, glistening in the sun, far out in the countryside. He owned 10 cows, all of which were all named Rudolph. He employed people to help by milking the cows. One day in the cow pen there were 10 people milking the cows. When they left, the cows pulled out a detonator, and blew up the gate, and as such they ended up escaping.
<div>The farmer sees the cows are gone, so he goes looking for them in the countryside, but these aren’t ordinary cows, so they can become invisible. He can’t find them, and he is still searching. He eventually drives away back to his farm since it’s late, the cows run into the city, and break into a shooting range.
</div><div>Before morning, the cows learn how to use guns, and steal some of them. So they start running around the city mugging people to buy stuff, and they each buy a skateboard. They used the standard mugging lines like any normal person would or wouldn’t use.
</div><div>“Give us all your money!” The cows said in unison.
</div><div>“No.” Said whoever they were mugging.
</div><div>Then the cows would pull out guns.
</div><div>“I’m still not giving you my money.” The person they were mugging would say
</div><div>The cows shoot a window, to prove they knew how to use guns.
</div><div>“Okay, you can have my money if you want it.”
</div><div>&nbsp;They go to the skate park and start skating and having a good time!
</div><div>The US Navy gets called on the cows, and as they approach the bank, a cop comes to arrest the cows, so the cows run after shooting out the cops tires, the cows start running away but then the cows decide they had enough, so they then hop onto and crash a helicopter sent by the Navy, once the cows crash the helicopter they all run, occasionally having to crash a helicopter, or shoot out a tire. They kept running and didn’t look back.  They escaped and hid inside a bank, skillfully hiding with invisibility. They ran out the back, and didn’t stop until they hit NASA headquarters.
</div><div>“Haha, yes, we will finally achieve our master plan!” Said a cow
</div><div>“Well, first we have to get in.” Replied another cow
</div><div>“We can just teleport” Chimed in a third cow
</div><div>&nbsp;And with that, they teleported inside of NASA. The plan was supposed to be simple, but they didn’t quite plan for contingencies. Within seconds they were spotted by a security guard. In a louzy escape attempt they started to turn back, but alas, the security guard was faster than them, they were quickly caught, and a tank was called in. Once the tank arrived they were escorted to court where they were put on trial.
</div><div>The cows were deemed guilty, and sentenced to life sentences in prison. But one day they found a talking biscuit, who said 
</div><div>“If you guys need help out of here, I can help you under one condition, you bring me with you.” 
</div><div>The cows then all said together “You have a deal, for now.”
</div><div>The biscuit said “Oh, that sounds very reassuring.”
</div><div>They all started planning. The end.

                    <strong>Chapter 2 (Evil Action Cows: The Return)</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">The cows had escaped from the prison, it was a long process, but they finally did it, taking the biscuit with them as they had promised. They had been in hiding for a few years, but they had made a plan and were finally putting it into motion. The plan had taken a long time to execute, and may or may not have led to the destruction of many different buildings, but alas, they were ready to finally put it into motion. Around midday, they were finally ready to finish the plan and exact revenge on the humans who had trapped them for so long!
<div>&nbsp;The biscuit was still not happy with the plans, he thought that just blowing up the planet would be too fast, and he thought about all the other people who hadn’t done anything, why destroy them fast, and not have anyone to torment, so, at the last minute, he ran into the control room.
</div><div>&nbsp;“STOP!” The biscuit said.
</div><div>&nbsp;“What? Why?” Said a cow.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Is something wrong?” said another cow.
</div><div>&nbsp;“No. This just feels wrong, killing all the humans though, it’s too much.” Said the biscuit.
</div><div>&nbsp;“But they sent us to prison, they wronged us.” Said yet another cow.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Yeah, but think about this. If we kill all the humans now, who are we to torment later? Instead, what if we just blow up the US, and then leave everywhere else alone? Then we still have other people we can torment.” Said the biscuit.
</div><div>&nbsp;All the other cows did agree it was a good point.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Fine.” Said all the cows in unison.
</div><div>&nbsp;But now, they had to retarget the laser. As little of an inconvenience as it may seem, it was a huge pain, since now, they had to wait for it to charge again, while already cutting it close for how much longer the ship can maintain invisibility. They also had to manually jumpstart the engine every time they retargeted, which could lead to many more issues. This didn’t discourage them though, and they did it.
</div><div>&nbsp;“How long till the laser is fully charged?” Said the talking biscuit.
</div><div>&nbsp;“About one more minute.” said a cow, staring thoughtfully at a screen full of numbers.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Finally, we will right the wrong that has been done to us!” screamed the biscuit, now full of excitement.
</div><div>&nbsp;“FREEZE WITH YOUR HANDS, or would it behooves, IN THE AIR!”
</div><div>&nbsp;Suddenly, they were surrounded by law enforcement, and with no other option, the cows made a desperate attempt to escape.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Why are you looking at us? You shouldn’t be standing here, you should be getting that guy over there!” a cow had screamed while pointing his hoof over at nothing.
</div><div>&nbsp;All the cops had turned away, this was the cows' chance. They turned back to the control panel and pressed the big red emergency button, the cows braced themselves, while the talking biscuit grabbed onto one. Suddenly, a hatch opened on the floor, and at 15,000 feet in the sky, everyone was pulled out. The cows pulled on release cords which opened up a parachute, the cops, however, just kept falling toward the endless depths of the pacific ocean.
</div><div>&nbsp;“More warning next time, please.” Said the biscuit.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Oh yeah, let’s just scream our plan to the cops, that would go great.” said a cow, sarcastically.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Stop arguing, please, it’s annoying,” said a second cow.
</div><div>“So how are we going to get back up?” Asked the biscuit.
</div><div>“We got it covered,” Said the cows in unison.
</div><div>Suddenly, they pulled a cord on the parachutes, and they were released into a free fall. Then, as quickly as the parachutes were gone, jetpacks had taken their place. As the cows started to fly back up to their spaceship. They thought about how their plan would succeed, and how it was too late to stop them. Suddenly, there was a loud boom from above, it was so bright, it hurt to look at it. The cops had attached remote explosives to the ship, they had saved the US and countless lives. The ship, flaming, started to lean and fell towards the ocean. The collision with a ship so big had caused a mini earthquake on the California coast. The cows, realizing they had no more options, landed on the ground in the nearest spot. Then, in the blink of an eye, they entered a duel with a cop, to end this, once and for all.
</div><div>“It’s over cows! I have the high ground” screamed the cop.
</div><div>And with alarm, they realized he was right, he was up on a hill.
</div><div>“You underestimate our power, cop!” replied the cows, and the biscuit, who was for some reason in the duel as well.
</div><div>The cows realized they would need more than just brute force if they wanted to leave alive. They started planning with each other in cow, and whatever language other than English a talking biscuit speaks. They had made a plan. Three of the ten cows turned invisible and started to sneak around and behind the cop. The other cows used their laser eyes as a distraction. The cop hadn’t realized until it was too late, by the time he was released from the cows' newly, and totally legally acquired, black windowless van, they were on some random street in the middle of Hollywood. Before he could even get back to his feet, the cows were long gone. He didn’t know where they were headed, or what they were planning next, but he knew he had to be there to stop it. For the sake of all humanity.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">They had just dropped off the cop when they were on their way toward Anaheim. They had some plans, plans the cop couldn’t ruin this time. First, they wanted to have some fun though, so they stopped at Disneyland, and teleported past the gates. They were in the park up till midnight, then they ended up leaving, and got ready to put their plans in motion finally. They went back to the totally legally acquired black windowless van. The plan was simple, if they couldn’t blow up the US from above, then blow it up from underneath. They knew it would take a while, and they also knew that time wasn’t exactly on their side, but they were still patient. Before they could execute the plan for destroying the US, they needed to figure out how, so they set out to make some blueprints. First, they found a giant ravine sealed off and hidden, and built a hidden entrance. Next, they needed something to power the giant explosion, as no singular Nuke would do, so they went to Walmart and bought some high-strength Atomic weapons. They rigged them all over the complex that they had built while that one cow ran the errands. They had built a master chamber, which was designed to be immune to the extreme heat, and radiation of the nukes. Though these weren’t regular bombs, they were designed to be high-power, however, that meant that they had to charge.
<div>&nbsp;“How on earth are they not charged yet!?” Said a biscuit, who was enraged, and had taken on the role of leader.
</div><div>&nbsp;“We have 69 giant nuclear bombs from Walmart, what did you expect?” Replied a cow.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Uh, well detonate whenever they finish and don’t wait, no matter what, we can’t let that stupid cop get in our way!” screamed the biscuit in response.
</div><div>&nbsp;Then, they heard movement above. They all went quiet.
</div><div>&nbsp;“I think I heard them below us?” Said a strange, high-pitched, almost shrill voice that the cows had never heard before.
</div><div>&nbsp;“That’s impossible, how would they be below us, there isn’t anything but solid rock for hundreds of miles.” Responded the cop.
</div><div>&nbsp;Immediately the cows went into a panic. Wondering intently how he had found them when they looked back at the dashboard. They realized the nukes were powered up, and the room was secured. Savoring this moment, the biscuit started screaming at the cows to press the big red button. Right as the cow was about to press the button, they heard an automated message come over the intercom from the random AI assistant they built, named Jarvis.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Atomic Bombs Number 1-36 disconnected, attempting detonation system reconnection…. System reconnection failed, unable to locate bombs. Please refer to the user's manual in section 3J, how to set up Walmart Original Atomic Bomb Remote Detonation System for assistance.”
</div><div>&nbsp;The bombs weren’t working anymore, confused, and slightly worried, they pressed the button on the rest. Expecting to hear a big boom from outside, it was much quieter, almost as if nothing had happened. The intercom clicked back on, with one message.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Atomic Bombs Number 37-69 detonation procedure failed, cannot continue until core system error has been resolved. The system will not shut down, and open the emergency release hatch.”
</div><div>&nbsp;That pesky cop had done it again, he had stopped them. They heard him coming down the stairs, and the second set of footsteps, though not wanting to find out who it was, they snuck out the back door. But not before locking the door that cop came through, to buy them even the littlest extra time to escape. But, when they were leaving, they saw something of unimaginable horror. It was so scary, it even caused one of the cows to pass out. It was….

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">They had spotted a giant, metallic cow. Instead of hooves, it had missile launchers. It was shooting lasers out of its eyes.
<div>“A GIANT EVIL ROBOT COW!” Screamed one of the cows.
</div><div>“Well, hey, it’s not my fault you guys never told me to stop, is it?” Replied the biscuit.
</div><div>“YOU DID WHAT?!” Said a different cow.
</div><div>“Seriously, someone shut those two up!” A cow had chimed in, claiming it was the most useful advice the group could take.
</div><div>“Alright, how do we stop it? Will it try to harm us?” Asked a cow.
</div><div>“Yeah, about that… you don’t stop it. It will try to kill you as well. I built it originally seeing you on TV, it was designed to be completely indestructible, specifically around what you guys can do.” Answered the biscuit, grimly.
</div><div>“Alright, well, we can deal with this” Replied yet another cow.
</div><div>&nbsp;“We totally can, did you forget that we were able to defeat a cop, even though he had the high ground!” Said yet another cow, though he sounded unsure.
</div><div>&nbsp;So they set out, trying to defeat the evil action robot cow. They first had the thought of trying to just hit it with lasers, however, once they did, the laser immediately bounced back. Then they started to wonder what else they could do.
</div><div>&nbsp;“Maybe we could try to teleport inside, which isn’t laser resistant.”
</div><div>&nbsp;They tried, but then once they did, they noticed they were in the antarctic.  They were curious about what happened but had no time to dwell on it. They teleported back to Anaheim, California where they were greeted by the sound of missiles exploding. The US Marines arrived. The missiles weren’t doing much, however, the cows got back to scheming. The cows eventually decide that they need to big-brain the robot. The first plan they decided on was to try to trick the robot into destroying itself, or more accurately, teleporting the robot inside of a volcano. One of the cows ran underneath it, grabbed onto its leg, and teleported right above a volcano. The cow quickly teleported away, and the robot cow fell inside a volcano. It slowly burned, the cows were victorious, and they teleported bto back to where they were to get the biscuit, but then they realized it too late. 
</div><div>&nbsp;“Put your hooves in the air!” Screamed the cop, who had a look of determination on his face.
</div><div>&nbsp;“You may have found us, but that doesn’t mean you’ve caught us!” screamed back a cow.
</div><div>&nbsp;“But you don’t realize, I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND!” screamed back the cop again
</div><div>&nbsp;“Well, we have something you don’t. A team!” replied yet another cow. 
</div><div>&nbsp;“Well, that’s what you think. Come on out team.” again, replied the cop.
</div><div>&nbsp;And with that, 10 vans rolled up, each one holding 16 swat officers. With that, the cows had been surrounded. They had nowhere to go. They were outnumbered. They put their hooves up, and we're escorted to a special prison, meant to hold them, and only them. They were put in separate cells and never allowed to see each other again. Just like that, their journey had come to an end. They would never see each other again. Or, at least, that’s what the cops thought.

                    <strong>Chapter 5 (Evil Action Cows: When Will I Stop This Madness)</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">It had been 7 weeks since the cows had been captured. They hadn’t been able to see each other since then, but that was fine, they didn’t need to. They had been leaving covert notes for each other, until eventually, on one long, fateful night, their plans had finally come together. They had been in some pretty basic prison cells, with wooden floorboards, little mats to sleep on (The cows were the animals, not the prison guards.), and little barred windows, too small for the cows to fit through. The plan to escape had been simple, yet effective. They had been unscrewing boards from the floor until eventually, they were able to get out. They had bought themselves more time by putting the boards on the mats, and pulling blankets over them, tricking the guards. Once all the cows and the biscuit had met up, they were ready for their biggest plan yet, the one that would finally end all their troubles.
<div>&nbsp;“Do you really think that'll work?” One of the cows had asked
</div><div>&nbsp;“Oh, I know it will.” Another had replied, with a smug grin on his face.
</div><div>&nbsp;The cows had devised a plan. The idea was simple, yet effective. Why build the bomb, when we can just hijack one? They planned to travel vast distances, but what would come of it would be worth it. They were going to sneak into a nuclear power plant, and overload one of the generators, causing only a little bit of the damage they wanted, but it was a start. They had begun the long trek, occasionally just getting so tired they would end up teleporting, but mostly, they walked, and walked, and walked. Once they had arrived at Steamy Stacks Nuclear Power Generation and Co. they were ready to begin the operation. Using teleportation, they snuck inside, they managed to grab hold of a granola bar somewhere along the way and threw it inside a nuclear generator. They then made sure to teleport far away, watching, as it exploded. They turned to leave, and they saw a mysterious van. They had wondered how long it had been following them when suddenly, the window started to roll down.
</div><div>&nbsp;“We meet again.” The cop said.
</div><div>&nbsp;“You!” All the cows said in unison.
</div><div>&nbsp;“You’re going down, and I mean it for the (hopefully) last time!” The cop had stated, matter-of-factly.
</div><div>&nbsp;“In your dreams.” The cow replied.
</div><div>&nbsp;Then, just like that, they entered a duel. The cop was prepared, they had lined the area with long-range snipers, as well as armed guards. The cows, seeing they were outnumbered, proceeded to teleport away. The cop realised what might happen if he lost the cows, so he set out after them immediately. The cows had decided to lure the cop into a trap. They had been slowly leading him to a construction zone, trapping the cop inside of a pit, somewhere to get him stuck. The cows looked behind them and saw the cop, they were ready. The cop, approaching, saw nothing but road barriers. Though he saw the cows on the other side, he stepped on the gas, rushing straight towards the barriers, and suddenly, the van started to drop. It hit the ground, landing on the hood with a loud thud. He opened the door and quickly got out. Looking around, he realised what had happened, he had fallen down into a hole, about six feet down, with flat edges, leaving no way to climb out. The cows had won, for now.
