                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">First off, this is my little web archive, comprised of games that I either found around the web, or made myself (let's be real, I didn't actually make any of these from scratch, except This Is Doomed). Feel free to play anyone of these games, as they are all accessible for free, though some of them may need an account. That being said, I do not take an responsibility if you get in trouble for this, as you are using this website at your own risk. Have fun.</p>
