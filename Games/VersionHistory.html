<h1>Version History</h1>
<p id="descriptor">This is a simple page containing every changelog for every version.</p>

<h3>Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release)</h3>
<p>Changes: Finalized some code changes for additional compatibility regardless of platform, as well as removing the internet dependency. (Has the side effect of bypassing GoGuardian on school chromebooks, but that totally means nothing, right?)</p>

<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<p>Changes: Updated some dependenices to patch some security flaws.</p>

<h3>Version 1.1.0</h3>
<p>Updates the Electron Client to remove offline files temporarily. This is due to certain parts of the Index being rebuilt from scratch in a more modifiable manner, as well as other planned changes. Additionally, this updates the Index to use the new link which (as of release) isn't blocked.</p>

<h3>Version 2.0.0</h3>
<p>An overhaul of everything. This version page is the only thing that remains. It's dangerous to go alone, take a changelog. <br>Updated FlappyJPEG. This change implements a new, second version of the game, named FlappyPNG. This is identical, just with different art for the bird. Which version you get is determined by a random number generator. <br> Rebuilds the main page in a more modifiable way, currently it doesn't look as fancy, however, eventually, I will attempt to work back to that, however, the old page was terribly difficult to add to, so this fixes that. <br> Adds in a version of Wordle designed by me, called WordleJS. <br> Adds in a version of Tic Tac Toe. <br> Adds in a version of Minesweeper. <br> Update and finish the Electron client to allow for offline support. <br> Adds a publicly accessible Version History<br>That should be all this update. Here, take a cookie. Goodbye, and see you next update.</p>

<h3>Version 2.1.0</h3>
<p>Re-add a missing game. Changes: <br> Re-implemented the Cookie Clicker client, this was mistakingly left out in the first release of V2.0.0, so this fixed it, happy clicking :).</p>

<h3>Version 2.1.1</h3>
<p>Ahh, it's that time again... well, let's do this. Changes: <br> Hopefully fixes an issue that prevented the Cookie Clicker Client from loading. Hopefully it works, I'm keeping an eye on it though.</p>

<h3>Version 2.1.2</h3>
<p>So soon? Weird, anyways. Changes: <br> Updates the version history page to fix the button leading to an outdated version of the main Index Of Games page.</p>

<h3>Version 2.1.3</h3>
<p>And already we're back after a lot of Detrimental Uno, but finally, it's ready, and tested. Changes: <br> Fix the fix for Cookie Clicker. It was tested now, so it actually works... YIPEE!!!</p>

<h3>Version 2.2</h3>
<p>Alrighty, here we go. Cookie Clicker has been the subject of another update.<br> Removes the ads below/above the upgrades menu. <br>There is something else coming soon, but just be patient on that as well please. One more additional change.<br> Removes Blurp Guys from appearing in the index. It was added by mistake, and isn't ready yet.</p>

<h3>Version 2.3</h3>
<p>And I'm back, I've done more stuff so that you can waste more of that time in school. <br> Removes some stuff from the Index. These are things that were still being worked on, and were added by mistake. <br> Fixes a few 404 errors by uploading some files that were missing. <br> Removed some old stuff from the web server, and moved some other things around to clear things up.<br> This update focused mainly on the server side stuff, to prepare for something I've been working on, so enjoy it for now.</p>

<h3>Version 2.4</h3>
<p>Another little update here. This one is fairly simple... <br> Updated Cookie Clicker to Version 2.052 from the previous version used of Version 2.021. This adds new building, new upgrades, achievements and more. <b> MAKE SURE YOU READ THE MESSAGE AT THE TOP OF THE INDEX </b> <br> Moves the original disclaimer to the bottom of the page, and the Cookie Clicker announcement to the top. </h3>
